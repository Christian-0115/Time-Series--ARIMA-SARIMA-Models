# XRP Forecasts with ARIMA & SARIMA

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models for forecasting the historical closing prices of XRP (Ripple).

## Introduction

A time series is a series of data points ordered in time, and it can be thought of as historical data. When forecasting a time series, time is usually the independent variable, and the goal is to forecast into the future. There are three main components to forecasting a time series: autocorrelation, seasonality, and stationarity.

1. Autocorrelation: The correlation between two observations at different points in a time series.

2. Seasonality: A recurring pattern that repeats over time in a time series, such as daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly variations.

3. Stationarity: The consistency of the data's statistical properties over time, such as a constant mean and variance.

## Models
This notebook focuses on XRP's historical closing price data using ARIMA and SARIMA models:

- ARIMA: A model that uses the dependencies between an observation and a number of lagged observations.

 - SARIMA: An extension of ARIMA that explicitly adds a seasonal component.
